              <h2>28,800 SECONDS: The Power of Teamwork</h2>
              <div class="small-12 columns">
                <p>After more than 40 years of accolades, honours and reminiscing, the members of Team Canada 1972 have launched a multi-faceted legacy venture as their way of giving back to Canadians. In October 2014, the 37 members of Team Canada 1972 launched “28,800 Seconds: The Power of Teamwork” to inspire every Canadian with the lessons learned from the Summit Series, particularly those highlighting what can be achieved through teamwork.</p>
                <div id="pillars">
                  <p>The “28,800 Seconds” venture consists of three pillars of focus for the members of Team Canada 1972 as a platform for giving back to Canadians:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>EDUCATION</li>
                    <li>ENTERTAINMENT</li>
                    <li>CHARITABLE FOUNDATION</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Each pillar represents a broad area the team has identified as an opportunity for them to give back and leverage the stories, lessons learned and passion felt by Canadians towards the 1972 Summit Series. The team intends to develop initiatives under each pillar in partnership with corporate Canada, leading universities and colleges, all levels of Government and the non-profit sector.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="ages">
                  <p>The 1972 Summit Series has a dramatically different emotional connection for Canadians depending on their age and how they have experienced this historic event. As such, the team has identified a very differentiated approach for each demographic:</p>
                  <div id="ageTypes">
                    <ul>
                      <li>Age 50+: Refresh the memories</li>
                      <li>Age 35-50: Confirm the legend</li>
                      <li>Age 20-35: Tell the story</li>
                      <li>Under 20: Advocate team values from what we learned</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p class="hide-for-small-only">For Canadians aged 50+, many experienced the 72 Summit Series first hand, remembering exactly where they were and what they were doing at the time. They have a very strong emotional connection to the series, and our goal is to reignite that passion within them. Canadians aged 35-50 may not have experienced the Series first hand, but they definitely understand the impact of this event - the legend of the 72 Summit Series would have been fresh in the memory of Canadians throughout the 70s and 80s. For those aged 20-35, many may have heard of the 72 Summit Series, but not fully understand it to any depth. This age group needs to hear the story of the Series, how it came to be, the impact it had on Canadians and the ripple effect it has had on sport, politics and Canadian society. Finally, the under 20 age group represents an amazing opportunity to reach back into Canadian history, using the 72 Summit Series as a medium to teach the next generation about “The Power of Teamwork.”</p>

                    <h3>National Education Curriculum</h3>
                    <p>The most powerful way for Team Canada 1972 to preserve its legacy for Canadians is through a national education platform, embedding the Team Canada 1972 story, lessons learned and history into the national school curriculum for Grades 2 to 12 in both English and French languages.</p>
                    <p>We will partner with school boards across Canada to develop age specific modules (across a broad spectrum of course topics), using the Team Canada 1972 platform to educate, engage and inspire youth.</p>
                    <p>We will provide access to online tools, content and resources to support and enhance the teaching and learning experience. We will supplement the classroom and online experience with live and/or virtual appearances from Team Canada 1972 team members and ambassadors.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Team Canada 1972 will launch a Leadership and Teamwork certification program, available to school boards across the country on a licensing basis. Individual teachers, classes and entire school boards can apply to be “Team Canada 72” certified – participating in training programs designed to inspire leadership and promote the power of teamwork. We will combine the Team Canada 72 story and the lessons it taught with leading edge, evidencebased research to develop this program. Today, school boards license similar programs, usually through American organizations. Our goal is to provide a Canadian version, delivered by Canada’s Team of the Century. Our ambassadors will train, mentor and inspire a nation of teachers and students.</p>
                    <p>Team Canada 1972 has secured strong partnerships with Brock University, Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame, Hockey Canada and several school boards to start to develop these programs.</p>
                    <p>The next phase of this national education program is to secure funding to build modules, develop online content, resources and capabilities, train ambassadors and develop program materials. Funding during the start-up phase is critical to the success and spread of the program.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the start-up phase, both the curriculum and the Leadership and Teamwork certification programs will be self-sustaining due to partnerships with corporate Canada, government and also direct licensing revenue from the school boards.</p>
                    <p>As the Team Canada 72 legacy lives on, it will inspire the hearts and minds of Canadian youth. It will last forever.</p>
                    <p>We know that the experience of Team Canada 72 will serve to motivate and inspire young people to adapt our methods to improve their lives and create a better Canada.</p>
