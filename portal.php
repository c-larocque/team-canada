        <p>The portal has a parent and student side. The parent side explains all of the features of the portal, breaking down what the students learn from each element. The student side has a kid-friendly, simple design and allows the students to either play the interactive game, scroll through fun facts or Team Canada 1972 history, or upload images to a student gallery.</p>
